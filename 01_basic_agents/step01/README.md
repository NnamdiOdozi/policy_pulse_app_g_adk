# Step 1: A Basic Agent without Tools

This is the first step in building an Agent Development Kit (ADK) agent.

This agent is designed to be very simple. It does not use any tools. Its behavior is entirely guided by its system instructions.

When you ask this agent about the weather in a specific city, it will respond in an approximate but mostly positive way. It doesn't have real-time weather data, so the response will be based on its training and the system instructions.

## Running the agent

To run this agent, navigate to this directory in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
adk web
```

This will start a web server and provide you with a URL to interact with the agent through a web interface.
